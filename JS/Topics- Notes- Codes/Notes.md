##### Generator Function

- Regular functions return only one, single value (or nothing).
- Generator functions can yeild multiple values on demand
- Unlike regular functions which run till the end, generator functions can be paused and resumed.

  ###### Where can generator functions be used ?

  - Infinite sequences
  - Iterating over large datasets- Traversing data structures
  - Lazy evaluation- generating values whenever needed

##### Factory Function

- Factory function is a function that returns new object without the need to use 'new' keyword.

##### Prototype 

- In JavaScript, every object has a property called prototype that is used to share properties and methods between instances of objects. 
- This is a core feature of JavaScript's object-oriented programming, enabling inheritance and the ability to extend objects.\

##### Prototype- Chain

- When you create an object using a constructor function, the newly created object’s prototype is automatically set to the constructor function’s prototype property.

#####  Proxy object

- A Proxy object in JavaScript is an object that wraps another object (called the target) and allows you to intercept and customize the behavior of fundamental operations on that target object.
